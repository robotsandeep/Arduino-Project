# 3D Printed Controllable Prosthetic Hand via Myoware Muscle Sensor

A controllable prosthetic hand using electromyoware to detect the gestures and muscle activities.  The project is aimed to be affordable, upgradable, repairable, and flexible.  To make it affordable, it consists of 3D printed parts for structure and only common electronic parts are being used.  The hand is controlled through EMG signals read by muscle activities on upper forearm.  These EMG signals are then transmitted via Sensor Cable- Electrode Pads to Arduino Uno.  The Arduino Uno then processes these signals and move 5 fingers with the help of servo motors accordingly.  The project is still in the early state with many areas could be improved.
